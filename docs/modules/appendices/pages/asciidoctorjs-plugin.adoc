= Working with Asciidoctor.js

Instead of {asciidoctorj-name}, {asciidoctorjs-url}[{asciidoctorjs-name}] can be used as a rendering engine from 3.0.

The configuration follows much the same as for {asciidoctorj-name}, but will a couple of differences.

* Only HTML is supported out of the box.
* The configuration extension is called `asciidoctorjs` and is available at both task and project level.
* Docbook must be enabled via `asciidoctorjs.modules.docbook.use()`.
* The implementation runs node.js under the hood, but the user does not have to install anything. The plugin suite takes care of everything.
* Additional NPM modules can be added via `asciidoctorj.require`.
