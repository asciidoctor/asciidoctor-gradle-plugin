== Known Issues

These are the main ones we know about:

* EPUB3 + KF8 in one task. Both formats in one task is currently failing. The exact failure message depends on which order
  (KF8+EPUB3 or EPUB3+KF8) the conversion takes place in.
* KF8 conversions fails under Windows. (Related to {issues-asciidoctorj}659[{asciidoctorj-name} #659] & {issues-jruby}4943[{jruby-name} #4943].

* Does not work with JDK9 (but does with JDK10).
* Not compatible with {kotlindsl} on Gradle *5.2.1* and *5.3*. See https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/1353[KOTLIN-DSL-1353].
