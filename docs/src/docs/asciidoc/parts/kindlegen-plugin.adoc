Producing KF* formats via the EPUB extension requires `kindlegen` to be installed. This plugin provides the capability of bootstrapping `kindlegen` on Windows, Mac & Linux without the user having to do anything.

There is a base plugin `org.asciidoctor.kindlegen.base` which just provides a `kindlegen` extension. In order to use it
you will need to agree to the Amazon terms of usage. To confirm this you need to configure

[source,groovy]
----
kindlegen {
  agreeToTermsOfUse = true
}
----

If you do not, then the plugin will refuse to bootstrap `kindlegen`.

NOTE: The base plugin is automatically applied by the EPUB plugin. If you only produce EPUB3 formats with the EPUB plugin you do not have to agree to the usage of `kindlegen`.
