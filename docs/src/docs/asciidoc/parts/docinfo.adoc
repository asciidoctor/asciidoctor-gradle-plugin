== Extra content for HTML & Docbook backends

You may need to include extra content into the head of the exported document.
For example, you might want to include jQuery inside the `<head>` element of the HTML export.
To do so, first create a docinfo file in your source directory i.e. `src/docs/asciidoc/docinfo.html` containing the content to include, in this case the `<script>` tag to load jQuery.

[source,html]
.src/docs/asciidoc/docinfo.html
----
<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.js"></script>
----

Then, add the `docinfo1` attribute to the attributes list in the previous example:

[source,groovy,role="primary"]
.build.gradle
----
asciidoctorj { // <1>
    attribute 'docinfo1', ''
}
----
<1> Substitute `asciidoctorjs` if you are using the {asciidoctorjs-name} engine.

See link:{asciidoctor-userguide}#docinfo-file[{asciidoctor-userguide-name}] for more information on `docinfo` and friends.
