== Compatibility

This collection of plugins requires at least Gradle 4.0, JDK 8.0 and {asciidoctorj-name} 1.6.0 to run. If you need prior Gradle,  JDK or {asciidoctorj-name} support please use a plugin from the 1.5.x or 1.6.x release series.

The 2.x range of these plugins are NOT compatible with https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs[Spring REST Docs]. If you have to use the latter then stick to the older v1.5.11 or v1.5.12 versions and do not manually set the version of {asciidoctorj-name} in your build script.
